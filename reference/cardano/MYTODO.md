backtesting and ml process

1. Split data into training (2021-2023), validation (2023-2024), and testing (2024-2025)
2. Train model on training data
3. Optimize hyperparameters on validation data
4. Final evaluation on testing data
5. Implement walk-forward analysis to simulate live trading

models to consider

	Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) for price direction prediction
	LSTM networks for time-series forecasting
	Reinforcement Learning for direct policy optimization
