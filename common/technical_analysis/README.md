4. **Data Source:**

class DataSource(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for different data sources"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Get data from source"""
        pass

class CSVDataSource(DataSource):
    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        self.file_path = file_path
    
    def get_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        return pd.read_csv(self.file_path)


Technical Analysis Class
The TechnicalAnalysis class is the heart of the script, responsible for:

Configuration Management: Loads configurations from a YAML file or uses default settings.
Environment Setup: Logs environment details.
Data Loading and Cleaning: Reads, cleans, and validates the dataset.
Indicator Calculations: Computes all specified technical indicators.
Summary Statistics: Generates and logs key statistics.
Results Saving: Outputs the analyzed data to a CSV file.

Visualization
The display_wide_chart function provides a split view of the price data and technical indicators, enhancing readability.

def display_wide_chart(df: pd.DataFrame, price_cols: List[str], indicator_cols: List[str]):
    """Display split view of price data and indicators"""
    cprint("\n=== Price Data ===", "white", "on_blue", attrs=['bold'])
    print("\nFirst 10 rows:")
    print(df[price_cols].head(10).to_string(index=True, justify='right'))
    print("\nLast 10 rows:")
    print(df[price_cols].tail(10).to_string(index=True, justify='right'))
    
    cprint("\n=== Technical Indicators ===", "white", "on_blue", attrs=['bold'])
    print("\nFirst 10 rows:")
    print(df[indicator_cols].head(10).to_string(index=True, justify='right'))
    print("\nLast 10 rows:")
    print(df[indicator_cols].tail(10).to_string(index=True, justify='right'))



Market Analysis
The main function orchestrates the analysis process, including:

Data Processing: Loading, cleaning, and computing indicators.
Display: Showing data and indicators.
Analysis: Performing market analysis and pattern detection.
Alerts: Generating trading alerts based on conditions.
Summary and Saving: Logging summary statistics and saving results.
Technical Indicators Explained
Understanding the technical indicators used is crucial for interpreting the analysis results.

Trend Indicators
Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculates the average price over a specified period, smoothing out price fluctuations.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices, reacting faster to price changes.
Triple EMA (TEMA): Further smooths the EMA to reduce lag.
Weighted Moving Average (WMA): Assigns different weights to data points, typically giving more importance to recent prices.
Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA): Adjusts the smoothing factor based on market volatility.
Triangular Moving Average (TRIMA): A double-smoothed SMA to provide a smoother trend line.
Momentum Indicators
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures the speed and change of price movements, indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Shows the relationship between two EMAs, signaling potential buy or sell opportunities.
Momentum (MOM): Calculates the rate of price change over a specified period.
Rate of Change (ROC): Measures the percentage change in price from one period to the next.
Williams %R (WILLR): Indicates overbought or oversold levels by comparing the current price to the highest high over a period.
Volatility Indicators
Average True Range (ATR): Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price.
Bollinger Bands (BBANDS): Consist of a middle SMA band and two outer bands representing standard deviations, indicating volatility and potential price reversals.
Volume Indicators
On-Balance Volume (OBV): Uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.
Money Flow Index (MFI): Combines price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure.
Handling NaN Values
The presence of NaN (Not a Number) values in your technical indicators is normal and expected. This occurs because indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI, etc., require a certain number of data points (defined by their period) to produce valid values. For instance, a 20-period SMA needs the first 20 data points to calculate the SMA for the 20th row.

Why NaN Values Appear
Insufficient Data Points: Initial rows don't have enough historical data to compute the indicators.
Indicator Periods: Longer periods result in more NaN values at the beginning.
Best Practices
Dropping NaN Rows: If the initial NaN rows are not essential, consider removing them to streamline your analysis.

python
Copy code
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=indicator_cols).reset_index(drop=True)
Filling NaN Values: Use with caution. Forward filling or backward filling can introduce inaccuracies.

python
Copy code
df_filled = df.fillna(method='ffill')  # Forward fill
Ignoring NaN Values: Some analytical methods handle NaN values gracefully by skipping them.

Ideas and Future Enhancements
This script serves as a robust foundation for technical analysis. Here are some ideas to further enhance its capabilities:

Advanced Pattern Recognition:
Implement algorithms to detect complex patterns like Head and Shoulders, Flags, Pennants, etc.

Backtesting Framework:
Develop a system to test trading strategies against historical data to evaluate their effectiveness.

Interactive Visualizations:
Integrate libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for dynamic and interactive charts.

Real-Time Data Integration:
Connect to APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) to perform real-time analysis and trading.

Machine Learning Integration:
Utilize machine learning models to predict price movements based on historical indicators.

User-Friendly Configuration:
Enhance the YAML configuration to allow dynamic adjustments without modifying the code.

Automated Reporting:
Generate comprehensive reports in formats like PDF or HTML for easy sharing and review.

Analogies from Different Domains
Understanding technical analysis can be akin to various concepts in different fields. Here are some analogies to simplify the understanding:

Weather Forecasting:
Technical Indicators are like weather instruments. Just as meteorologists use tools to predict weather patterns, traders use indicators to anticipate market movements.

Sports Analytics:
Think of RSI as a player's stamina. When a player's stamina is low (RSI is high), they might underperform, signaling a potential strategic change.

Engineering Signals:
Moving Averages are similar to filters in signal processing. They smooth out noise to reveal the underlying trend, much like how engineers filter signals to remove unwanted frequencies.

Music Beats:
MACD can be compared to the tempo of a song. Changes in tempo (MACD crossovers) can indicate shifts in the song's mood, similar to how MACD signals shifts in market momentum.
Navigation Systems:

Support and Resistance Levels are like road signs. They guide traders on potential entry and exit points, much like how road signs guide drivers on their journey.

Health Monitoring:
ATR is analogous to a heart rate monitor. It gauges the volatility (stress) in the market, similar to how a heart rate monitor assesses the stress level of a person.
